## The iterators lab 

This lab builds on your implementation of SortedArray from [The Sorted Array Lab](https://github.com/wdi-sf-jan-2014/sorted_array). Make sure all your specs pass for that lab before starting on this one. The file [sorted_array_spec.rb](sorted_array_spec.rb) has some new specs that you need to satisfy. The specs for `SortedArray#map` onward do not exist in the spec file. Start with the spec for the behavior you want, and then write the least amount of code to get the spec to pass.

Bonus

Implement `SortedArray#inject`. See if you can get it to work exactly
like `Array#inject`.
